# Real-Time-Event-Detection-with-Visual-Evidence-System
This project implements a real-time embedded event detection system based on STM32F411, designed to detect critical motion or shock events and transmit geo-tagged event data over Ethernet.  The system is architected to be scalable, with planned integration of ESP32-CAM to capture and associate visual evidence with detected events.
